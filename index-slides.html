                                500 days into this relationship and I can feel myself changed for good only because of you. ‚ù§Ô∏è<br>
                                500 days in this relationship out of which 200 days were spent together, yet here we are stronger than before. ‚ù§Ô∏è<br> 
                                500 days in this relationship and I understand the true essence of love. ‚ù§Ô∏è<br>
                                500 days in this relationship and I got to know about the importance of a life partner. ‚ù§Ô∏è<br> 
                                500 days into this relationship and I got my best 3 am partner. ‚ù§Ô∏è<br>
                                500 days into this relationship and I have developed a habit of checking two horoscopes daily. ‚ù§Ô∏è<br>

                                    If people ask me now that "Are you Changed??", I proudly say Yes, I changed for good and someone better made me change myself, made me change my attitude 
                                    towards how I see myself and how I look upto a certain things.‚ù§Ô∏è Yes I changed for the girl I love the most and plan my future with. I changed because I wanted to upgrade myself
                                    so that I can have you. You changed me, but for my own benefit, for the sake of this relationship. Today is such a great and an eventful day that I can't forget. Its your Birthday 
                                    and it's our 500th Day of being a pain in the ass for each other. 500th Day of torturing each other. 500th day of sledging each other (PS: You sledge me way more but I still Love it). 
                                    500th Day of taking care of each other and supporting each other through thick and thin. I have never seen or imagined about a girl, the way I do for you. 
                                    I was not a 3 am person but with you, I understand the meaning of late night talks and fantasies.‚ù§Ô∏è I wasn't a patient person, but with you I learned how to handle things calmly.
                                    I wasn't a person to have long calls but with you hours seems like minutes. I wasn't a person to text all day but with you I do not wanna let my phone and Snapchat rest.
                                    Because YOU are the right person for me and YOU are my person. YOU are an addiction, worst than alcohol but healthier than alcohol. I know that when sometimes when I say
                                    that in the next 6-7 years I see myself with you, it seems vague and you do not plan and look forward for the future but let me tell you that I look forward for our great future
                                    and plan things for it because I am ready to fight and undergo anything to keep you by my side for as long as I can and fulfil my desire of having you permanently like I did by proposing you for this relationship coz I wanted this, the moment I saw you laughing. ‚ù§Ô∏è
                                    Nobody can predict the future but we can hope and pray and I hope for a great future with you, a never ending future because I wanna get annoyed by you till my last breath and want to see you grow old with me. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è<br>
                                    You know that your laughter and your smile is what keeps me going and makes me happy. I just want you to stay happy and stay laughing because you look better and cuter like that
                                    and I promise to keep that laughter on your face no matter what it takes. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è <br>
                                    And I wanna be with you because of what I plan to do in Switzerland üôàüôà‚ù§Ô∏èüôàüôà <br>
                                    Once again A very Happy Birthday...‚ù§Ô∏è <br>
                                    May you keep shining like a bright star ‚ù§Ô∏è<br>
                                    I Love You ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è<br>
